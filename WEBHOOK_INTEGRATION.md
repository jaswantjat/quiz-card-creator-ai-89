# Webhook Integration Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully integrated the QuestionGenerationForm with a webhook endpoint while preserving all existing functionality and user experience. The integration sends form data to the specified webhook before proceeding with question generation.

## 🔗 Webhook Configuration

### **Webhook Details**
- **URL**: `https://primary-production-1cd8.up.railway.app/webhook/c6ef8f24-74f3-4781-9d60-13e917c7d2a7`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Webhook ID**: `c6ef8f24-74f3-4781-9d60-13e917c7d2a7`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

### **Payload Structure**
```json
{
  "webhookId": "c6ef8f24-74f3-4781-9d60-13e917c7d2a7",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "formData": {
    "context": "User-provided context for questions",
    "topicName": "Machine Learning",
    "easyCount": 2,
    "mediumCount": 3,
    "hardCount": 1,
    "totalQuestions": 6
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "iQube Question Generator",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "url": "https://genrate-with-ai-feature-production.up.railway.app/chat-agent"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Implementation Details

### **Files Modified**

#### **1. src/lib/api.ts**
- Added `webhookAPI` service with `sendQuestionGenerationData` function
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Proper request/response structure

#### **2. src/pages/ChatAgent.tsx**
- Enhanced `handleGenerate` function with webhook integration
- Added webhook status state management
- Form validation before webhook submission
- Graceful error handling with fallback to question generation

#### **3. src/components/QuestionGenerationLoader.tsx**
- Added webhook status indicator
- Real-time status updates (sending, success, error)
- Enhanced user feedback during webhook processing

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### **Step-by-Step Process**
1. **Form Validation**: Validates topic name and question count
2. **Webhook Sending**: Sends form data to webhook endpoint
3. **Status Display**: Shows webhook status in loading overlay
4. **Question Generation**: Continues with existing question generation
5. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/error states

### **Loading States**
- **Sending to webhook...** (Blue indicator)
- **Webhook sent ✓** (Green indicator)  
- **Webhook failed ⚠** (Red indicator, but continues with generation)

## 🔧 Error Handling

### **Webhook Failure Scenarios**
- **Network errors**: Timeout, connection issues
- **HTTP errors**: 4xx, 5xx status codes
- **Invalid responses**: Malformed JSON, unexpected format

### **Graceful Degradation**
- If webhook fails, question generation continues normally
- User receives error notification but process isn't interrupted
- All existing functionality remains intact

## 📊 Logging and Debugging

### **Console Logging**
```javascript
// Webhook request
🔗 Sending data to webhook: https://primary-production-1cd8.up.railway.app/webhook/...
📊 Form data: { context: "...", topicName: "...", ... }

// Success response
✅ Webhook response: { status: 200, data: {...} }

// Error handling
❌ Webhook error: Error message details
```

### **Toast Notifications**
- **Success**: "Form data sent to webhook successfully!"
- **Error**: "Webhook failed, but continuing with question generation"
